# Advanced GIS Portfolio
A creative approach to GIS stlye, design, analysis, and more. 

# About Me
Hello, my name is Maria T. Khan and I'm currently taking a course in Advanced GIS at Carnegie Mellon University. Learn a little bit more about me in my short bio below. 

Maria T. Khan is a writer, daughter, immigrant, a proud Muslim-American and an occasional poet. She is pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management with a data analytics concentration at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Heinz College and holds a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies with honors from the University of California, Irvine. An alumna of the prestigious Coro Public Affairs Fellowship in Southern California, Maria has worked with cross-disciplinary sectors on research and development, corporate social responsibility, and community engagement, primarily in her hometown of Los Angeles. She seeks to become a storyteller who uses data to highlight gaps in migrant labor patterns, improve resettlement systems, and advocate for effective immigration policies. Maria will graduate in May 2020 with her MS and is currently seeking opportunities in policy and data analysis.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how GIS can be customized to be a useful analytical tool for a varied number of audienced. GIS is increasingly important to understand populations as our daily environments continue to affect individual behavior, opportunity, and more. As a policy focused analyst, maps are more than arbitrary symbols to help navigate from location A to location B. Maps often serve the extent to which certain programs/policies/laws/services need to be provided. Furthermore, organizations often have a limited pool of funding and GIS is a way that can help highlight areas of high priority. In this course, Advanced GIS, I hope to hone in on my map-styling/making skills to enhance their use in the public affairs and public service space.
